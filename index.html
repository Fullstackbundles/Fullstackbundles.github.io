                <h2 class="text-center stevejobslife">The Life Of Steve Jobs</h2>
        <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>1955:</strong> Steve Jobs was born February 23, 1955</li>
        <li>He was born to a Wealthy Arab Syrian Father, and an American Catholic Mother.</li>
            <li> Steve was given up for Adoption because of the disapproval his mother faced from her father</li>
            <li>He was adpoted by Paul of Clara Jobs and lived in California</li>
            <li><strong>1967:</strong> Bill Fernandez, a fellow electronics hobbyist who was in Jobs's grade at Cupertino Junior High, was his first friend there </li>
            <li>Fernandez eventually introduced Jobs to 18-year-old electronics whiz and Homestead High alumn Steve Wozniak, who lived across the street from Fernandez.</li>
            <li><strong>1968:</strong> Jobs was given a summer job by Bill Hewlett (of Hewlett-Packard) after Jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for an electronics project:</li>
             <li><strong>1972:</strong> Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Reed was an expensive college which Paul and Clara could ill afford. He later dropped out of school </li>
             <li><strong>1973: </strong> Steve Wozniak designed his own version of the classic video game Pong. After finishing it, Wozniak gave the board to Jobs, who then took the game down to Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California. Atari thought that Jobs had built it and gave him a job as a technician.</li>
             <li><strong>1974:</strong> Jobs traveled to India in mid-1974 to visit Neem Karoli Baba at his Kainchi ashram with his Reed friend (and eventual Apple employee) Daniel Kottke, in search of spiritual enlightenment. </li>
             <li><strong>1975: </strong> Jobs and Wozniak attended meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club</li>
            <li><strong>1976:</strong> Wozniak invented the Apple I computer and showed it to Jobs, who suggested that they sell it. Jobs, Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne formed Apple Computer in the garage of Jobs's Los Altos home on Crist Drive </li>
             <li> <strong>1977:</strong> In 1977, Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire. It was the first consumer product sold by Apple Computer and was one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, It was designed primarily by Steve Wozniak.</li>
             <li><strong>1978: </strong> Brennan gave birth to her baby, Lisa Brennan, on May 17, 1978. This baby was fathered by Steve Jobs, but he denied it heavily at the time.</li>
             <li><strong>1983: </strong> Jobs lured John Sculley away from Pepsi-Cola to serve as Apple's CEO, asking, "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?</li>
             <li><strong>1984: </strong>  Apple introduced the Macintosh, which was based on The Lisa.(a computer he named after his daughter)he following year, Apple aired a Super Bowl television commercial titled "1984." At Apple's annual shareholders meeting on January 24, 1984, an emotional Jobs introduced the Macintosh to a wildly enthusiastic audience; Andy Hertzfeld described the scene as "pandemonium.</li>
             <li> <strong>1985 : </strong> In May 1985, Sculley—encouraged by Arthur Rock—decided to reorganize Apple, and proposed a plan to the board that would remove Jobs from the Macintosh group and put him in charge of "New Product Development." This move would effectively render Jobs powerless within Apple.  A few months later, on September 17, 1985, Jobs submitted a letter of resignation to the Apple Board. Five additional senior Apple employees also resigned and joined Jobs in his new venture, NeXT.</li>
             <li>Following his resignation from Apple in 1985, Jobs founded NeXT Inc. with $7 million. A year later he was running out of money, and he sought venture capital with no product on the horizon. Eventually, Jobs attracted the attention of billionaire Ross Perot, who invested heavily in the company.</li>
            <li><strong> 1986: </strong> In 1986, Jobs funded the spinout of The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) from Lucasfilm's computer graphics division for the price of $10 million, $5 million of which was given to the company as capital and $5 million of which was paid to Lucasfilm for technology rights.[</li>
            <li><strong>1989: </strong>  Making use of a NeXT computer, English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN in Switzerland. </li>
             <li> <strong>1990: </strong> NeXT workstations were first released in 1990 and priced at US$9,999. Like the Apple Lisa, the NeXT workstation was technologically advanced and designed for the education sector, but was largely dismissed as cost-prohibitive for educational institions.</li>
             <li>The revised, second generation NeXTcube was released in 1990. Jobs touted it as the first "interpersonal" computer that would replace the personal computer. With its innovative NeXTMail multimedia email system, NeXTcube could share voice, image, graphics, and video in email for the first time. "Interpersonal computing is going to revolutionize human communications and groupwork", Jobs told reporters</li>
             <li><stronng>1994: </stronng> The company reported its first profit of $1.03 million</li>
             <li><strong>1996: </strong> NeXT Software, Inc. released WebObjects, a framework for Web application development. </li>
             <li><strong>1997 :</strong> In 1996, Apple announced that it would buy NeXT for $427 million. The deal was finalized in February 1997, bringing Jobs back to the company he had cofounded. Jobs became de facto chief after then-CEO Gil Amelio was ousted in July 1997. He was formally named interim chief executive in September.</li>
             <li>Jobs changed the licensing program for Macintosh clones, making it too costly for the manufacturers to continue making machines.With the purchase of NeXT, much of the company's technology found its way into Apple products, most notably NeXTSTEP, which evolved into Mac OS X.</li>
             <li>Under Jobs's guidance, the company increased sales significantly with the introduction of the iMac and other new products; since then, appealing designs and powerful branding have worked well for Apple.</li>
            <li><strong> 2000: </strong>At the 2000 Macworld Expo, Jobs officially dropped the "interim" modifier from his title at Apple and became permanent CEO.[96] Jobs quipped at the time that he would be using the title "iCEO".</li>
             <li>The company subsequently branched out, introducing and improving upon other digital appliances. With the introduction of the iPod portable music player, iTunes digital music software, and the iTunes Store, the company made forays into consumer electronics and music distribution.</li>
             <li><strong>2011: </strong>On August 24, 2011, Jobs announced his resignation as Apple's CEO, writing to the board, "I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come." Jobs became chairman of the board and named Tim Cook as his successor as CEO. Jobs continued to work for Apple</li>
             <li>Jobs died at his Palo Alto, California home around 3 p.m. (PDT) on October 5, 2011, due to complications from a relapse of his previously treated islet-cell neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer,which resulted in respiratory arrest.</li>
